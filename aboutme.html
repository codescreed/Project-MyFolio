		<h2>Music is the key ingredient of happiness </h2>
		<p>I am a big fan of indian music .I love unplugged versions of bollywood songs . Favorite music shows are MTV coke studio . I also love to listen to pakistani singers , as they have an amazing voice. I also loves listening to old songs because they are the evergreen compositions especiall songs by Kishore kumar , Mohd. Rafi and many more . Music just brings inside me a refreshed feeling . I even love to spend on classy headset pairs so that the feeling for music doesn't get disturbed. I also prefer to listen music during my working because it keeps me focussed to my work and makes it less boring :D .
